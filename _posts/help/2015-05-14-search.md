You can find specific posts and people on Ello using search. Follow the logic instructions below to refine your search results.

**Exact Phrases**

_Example: "giant pandas"_

Use quotation marks to search for an exact phrase.



* * *

**Union** 

_Example: panda OR lion_

Use OR to find posts that contain either word.

* * * 

**Intersection**

_Example: panda AND lion_

Use AND if you only want to see posts that include both pandas and lions.

* * * 

**Common Words** 

_Example: +that panda_

Common words like "that" are excluded from content search. If you want it to be included, add a + before the word.

Alternatively, if you want to not include a certain word in the search, you can add a - before it.

* * * 


**Exclusion**

_Example: giant panda AND NOT baby_

Want to find some giant pandas, but don’t want to see any panda babies? Use AND NOT to avoid posts that include "baby".

* * * 

**Proximity**

_Example: giant NEAR panda_

This will return posts that have giant and panda within a certain number of words of each other.


* * * 

**Nesting**

_Example: "giant pandas" AND (lions OR dogs)_

Use () when there are multiple operations. In this example, you want posts about giant pandas and lions, or giant pandas and dogs. 

* * * 

**Permalinks**

If you’d like to link someone directly to a specific search, add “?terms=“ after the search url. For example, “https://ello.co/search?terms=car”.
