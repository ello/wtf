## How do I contact Ello?

Ello is run by a small team of real people who are very busy building Ello, so we ask that you only contact us if you can’t find help elsewhere.

**Abusive behavior reports:** [reportabuse@ello.co](mailto:reportabuse@ello.co)  
**Bug reports:** [bugs@ello.co](mailto:bugs@ello.co)  
**Feature suggestions:** [suggestions@ello.co](mailto:suggestions@ello.co)  
**Jobs:** More info here.  
**Everything else:** [hello@ello.co](mailto:hello@ello.co)  

You can also mention @wtf directly on Ello.

## How do I report abusive behavior?

Ello has a zero-tolerance policy for hate, trolling, stalking, spamming, flaming, impersonating others, harming children, or any other behavior designed to hurt another person physically or emotionally.

All users must follow the Ello Rules, and there are consequences for not following the Rules. If you notice abusive behavior, please report it immediately to [reportabuse@ello.co](mailto:reportabuse@ello.co). We will look into it, and take necessary action as soon as possible.

## How do I report copyright or trademark infringement?

Ello complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Please read our Terms of Use here for more information on reporting copyright infringement.

To report trademark infringement, please e-mail [reportabuse@ello.co](mailto:reportabuse@ello.co). If you are unable to claim an unassigned username, it may be reserved. Check by e-mailing us.

## Press requests?

Requests from the working press can be sent to [press@ello.co](mailto:press@ello.co). We cannot respond to emails on other subjects sent to the press email address.

## Ello and accessibility.

We are creating Ello to work for everyone. Ello is developing special features to aid members of the Ello community who have a disability. Check back for more news about these features as they roll out. E-mail [accessibility@ello.co](mailto:accessibility@ello.co) with questions.

**We’ll get back to you as fast as we can. Forgive any slow replies. We’re busy working on Ello!**
