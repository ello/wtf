In the Ello Omnibar, you have a great deal of control over how your text looks. You can **bold**, _italicize_, and <strike>strikethrough</strike> text. You can create lists, links and much more!

Read on to learn how.

## Use the text WYSIWYG

The simplest way is to highlight some of the text in your Omnibar post. A small WYSIWYG appears, which will allow you to make your text bold, italic, or add a link.

If you wish to format text in other ways, or want to enter formatting commands quickly using your keyboard, read on below to learn how to use Ello Markdown Language.

## Ello Markdown

For more advanced text editing, Ello uses Markdown, a series of formatting commands that you enter with your keyboard as you type. Ello Markdown is a fast, simple way to type special characters that tell Ello how to display your text.

We chose to include Markdown as a way to format text in the Omnibar for its simplicity, flexibility, and ubiquity. Programmers have been using Markdown since the late 1980’s, but anyone can use it and it is very easy to learn. 

Below is a guide to Ello Markdown.

## Making text Bold and Italic

Surround the text you want to format using asterix (*) symbols.

To create italics, use a single asterix on either side of a block of text, like this:

`*This text will be italic*`

*This text will be italic.*

Surrounding text by two asterix makes text bold:

`**This text will be bold**`

**This text will be bold**

Both * or _ symbols work to make text bold or italic. This way you can combine bold and italic as needed in the same sentence. For example:

`**Everyone _must_ drink beer at 7 o’clock today.**`

**Everyone _must_ drink beer at 7 o’clock today.**

## Strikethrough

Put a double ~ symbol on either side of the text you want to strikethrough. For example:

`~~I don’t like cheese~~`

<p><strike>I don’t like cheese</strike></p>

## Bulleted Lists

Make a bulleted list by preceding list items with a single asterix (*). Note that you need a space between the asterix and the text.

* Clean Shaven
* Bearded
* Furry

## Numbered Lists

Create a numbered list by preceding list items with a number.

1. Apple.
2. Banana.
3. Vaseline.

## Links

Create a text link by wrapping the linked text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the link in parenthesis ( ).

For example, type this:

`[Visit Ello Now!](https://www.ello.co)`

and get this:

[Visit Ello Now!](https://www.ello.co)
