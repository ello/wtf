## What’s the Omnibar????

The Omnibar is the black bar next to your profile image at the top of your stream, and you use it to post things on Ello. You can also use the Omnibar to mention others in your posts, to comment on other people’s posts, and very shortly, to send private message to your friends.

## How do I use the Omnibar?

You can put just about anything in the Omnibar. Here are some things you can do:

1. Type, cut, paste & format text.

2. Drag & drop image files, including .JPG, .GIF, animated .GIF, and .PNG files.

3. Select an image from your computer by clicking the browse files icon within the omnibar modal.

4. Mention other people on Ello by adding an `@` symbol in front of their username. For example, @budnitzbicycles or @bergerfohr.

5. Create links by highlighting text in the Omnibar and clicking the link icon.

6. Embed video files by entering a Youtube, Vimeo, DailyMotion, or Ustream URL link directly into the Omnibar.

7. Embed audio files by entering a Soundcloud, Mixcloud, or Bandcamp URL link directly into the Omnibar.

8. Use the keyboard shortcut command + enter/return (Mac) or control + enter (Windows) to submit your post.

## Why does the Omnibar background change color?

The Omnibar background is GREY by default when you are composing a post. The background will turn YELLOW when Ello recognizes that you have mentioned another user in your post using the `@` symbol in front of their username.

## How do I create a post that contains a mixture of images, text, video, links, etc.?

Each Omnibar post can be made up of multiple containers. Each container can hold an image, text, video links, and more. Containers can be re-ordered on the fly, which gives you a great deal of control over how your posts look.

To create a new image container from a text container, simply click on the image icon at the bottom right corner of the open Omnibar. To create a new text container from an image container, just start typing in the blank container at the bottom of the Omnibar.

## How can I rearrange the order of images, text, and other stuff I put in the Omnibar?

Click and drag the arrow icon in the corner of each container in the Omnibar to move it up and down, until it snaps to the desired position within your post.

## How can I format text and add links to my posts in the Omnibar?

The simplest way is to highlight the portion of text that you want to format. A small edit menu pops up that allows you to add a link, or change the style of your text to bold or italic.

![Edit menu](https://d324imu86q1bqn.cloudfront.net/uploads/asset/attachment/3034185/ello-optimized-fceaa359.jpg)

Alternatively, you can use [Ello Markdown](/wtf/help/text-formatting/) to create advanced text formatting. Read how [here](/wtf/help/text-formatting/).

## How can I add emoji to my posts?

To use an emoji in your post, begin by typing a colon : in your post or comment. A pop-up menu will appear offering you a choice of Emojis! [Read more here.](/wtf/resources/emojis/)

:ello:

## Can I use big images and enter lots of text?

Ello can display large, full-screen images and very long text posts. There is no size limit.

## How can I view giant images that don’t fit my screen?

Resize large images just by clicking on them.

## Can I edit a post once I’ve put it up?

Yes. Click the edit icon under any post.

![Edit image icon](https://d324imu86q1bqn.cloudfront.net/uploads/asset/attachment/2199977/ello-xhdpi-418514f0.jpg)

## Can I comment on a post?

Yes! Click on the speech bubble underneath the post to show its comments. A box will appear for you to enter your comment.

![Comments icon](https://d324imu86q1bqn.cloudfront.net/uploads/asset/attachment/2497412/ello-xhdpi-a8a3392f.jpg)

## Can I repost another person’s post?

Yes. Just hit the repost button underneath the post you like, and you will see the original post in your Omnibar. Add additional thoughts below the original post and hit the grey arrow to submit your post.

![Comments icon](https://d324imu86q1bqn.cloudfront.net/uploads/asset/attachment/2498020/ello-xhdpi-2d2e8447.jpg)

Next to the repost icon, you will see a grey number. Click it to see everyone that’s reposted that post. If you don’t want anyone to repost your posts, you can disable reposting on your Settings page.

## If I delete a post, what happens to reposts of my post?

All reposts of your post will be deleted too.

## How do I find my friends?

Go to the [Search]({{ site.webapp_url }}/search) page and type your friend's name or username.

On the Discover page of iOS mobile app, you can use the "Find My Friends" feature, which uses the e-mail addresses in your contact list. Just follow the instructions using the “Find My Friends” pop-up.

Ello does not save the email addresses of the people in your contact list, and will always ask your permission before following, finding, or inviting them!

## How are e-mails protected when importing friends on the Ello mobile apps?

When you agree to let the Ello app access your contact list to find your friends, email addresses are one-way hashed with a salt, and not permanently stored by Ello.

## What if I don't want people to find me on Ello?

On your [Settings]({{ site.webapp_url }}/settings) page just set "Discoverable" to “No”. Then no one will be able to find you using the "Find my friends" feature on the mobile app!

## How do I invite my friends?

Click on your avatar in the upper right hand corner, select "[Invite](https://ello.co/invitations)", and follow the instructions.

Friends can also join on the [Ello Home Page]({{ site.webapp_url }}/).

## How can I use the discover tool to find interesting people and/or things to follow?

Click on [Discover]({{ site.webapp_url }}/discover) in the upper right hand corner. Select “Recommended”, “Related”, or “Random”. Select people based on the content that you find interesting.


## How do I find other people that share my interests?

Find people and posts that inspire you just by typing whatever it is you're looking for into the [Search]({{ site.webapp_url }}/search) bar. Check out the community directory [here](/wtf/resources/community-directory/).

Hashtags are live on Ello too. Use hashtags to organize your posts and find things by interest. You can also search for hashtags on Ello: for example, when you search "#art", posts with the hashtag "#art" will appear on top of your search, with related results below.

## How can I search through everything on Ello?

Click the [Search]({{ site.webapp_url }}/search) icon, type in the keyword that you're looking for, and hit go. Use [search words](/wtf/help/search/) to improve your search.

![Search icon](https://d324imu86q1bqn.cloudfront.net/uploads/asset/attachment/2385623/ello-xhdpi-23fb718d.jpg)

## How can I keep Ello organized using the FRIENDS and NOISE streams?

When we first created Ello, we wanted to avoid the clutter associated with other networks. So we created two streams, FRIENDS and NOISE. This means that you have two places to put the people you follow!

You can use FRIENDS and NOISE any way you like, but after two years of using Ello with our own friends, this is what we recommend:

Put the people you care about most in the FRIENDS stream. FRIENDS uses an expanded list layout, it is easy to view each of your friend’s posts in detail, full-screen.

Use the NOISE stream to follow anything and everything else. NOISE has a compressed, fluid grid layout that makes it easy to browse and scan lots of text and images quickly.

Only you can see who is in your FRIENDS stream and who is in your NOISE stream. Nobody else will ever know where you have put them, so you don’t have to worry about hurting anybody else’s feelings.

More info [here](/wtf/help/friends-and-noise/).

## How can I see all my own posts (and nobody else’s)?

Click on your avatar in the upper right hand corner and select your username.

## How do I view an individual post?

Click on the time stamp (e.g. “4d”) next to the post.

## How can I save posts that I really like?

Bookmark them in your Loves stream! Just click the heart underneath any post you love.

![loves-button](https://d324imu86q1bqn.cloudfront.net/uploads/asset/attachment/3034184/ello-optimized-ad609cb2.jpg)

## How can I see everything I’ve loved?

Click on your avatar in the upper right hand corner and select "Loves".

## How can I see what other people love?

Navigate to another person’s profile and click on “Loves” underneath their username.

![users-loves](https://d324imu86q1bqn.cloudfront.net/uploads/asset/attachment/3034183/ello-optimized-a2e66a96.jpg)

## How do I get to my Settings?

You can get to your [Settings]({{ site.webapp_url }}/settings) page by clicking on your avatar in the upper right-hand corner and selecting "Settings" from the dropdown list.

## How can I change my avatar and header?

On your [Settings]({{ site.webapp_url }}/settings) page, drag & drop images directly in the avatar and header areas. You can also click on the image icon inside the avatar or header area to use your browser to select a file from your computer or mobile device.

## How do I log out?

You can log out by clicking on your avatar in the upper right-hand coner and selecting “Logout” from the dropdown list.

You can also log out on the [Settings]({{ site.webapp_url }}/settings) page.

## How can I permanently delete my Ello account?

On your [Settings]({{ site.webapp_url }}/settings) page, click the “Delete Account” link. Once you delete your account neither you, nor we, can recover it. It’s over, baby. Also note that your username may become available for another person to use.

## Where can I find the Ello logo to put on my web site?
