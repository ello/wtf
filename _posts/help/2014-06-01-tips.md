## What's the Omnibar?

The Omnibar is the black bar next to your user profile image at the top of your stream, and you use it to post things on Ello. You can also use the Omnibar to mention others in your posts, to comment on other people's posts, and very shortly, to send private message to your friends.

![Omnibar](https://d324imu86q1bqn.cloudfront.net/uploads/asset/attachment/915/ello-optimized-540972b6.jpg)

## How do I use the Omnibar?

You can put just about anything in the Omnibar. Here are some things you can do:

1. Type, cut, paste & format text.

2. Drag & drop image files, including .JPG, .GIF, animated .GIF, and .PNG files.

3. Select an image from your computer by clicking the browse files icon within the omnibar modal.

4. Mention other Ello users by adding an `@` symbol in front of their username. For example, [@budnitzbicycles](/budnitzbicycles) or [@bergerfohr](/bergerfohr). The Omnibar background will turn yellow when Ello recognizes that you have mentioned another user in your post.

5. Create links by highlighting text in the Omnibar and clicking the arrow icon.

6. Embed video files by entering a Youtube, Vimeo, or DailyMotion URL link directly into the Omnibar.

7. Embed audio files by entering a Soundcloud or Mixcloud URL link directly into the Omnibar.

8. Use the keyboard shortcut command + enter/return (Mac) or control + enter (Windows) to submit your post.

## Why does the Omnibar background change color?

The Omnibar background is GREY by default when you are composing a post. The background will turn YELLOW when Ello recognizes that you have mentioned another user in your post using the `@` symbol in front of their username. And if you start a post with `@@` (two `@` symbols in front of a username), the Omnibar background will turn RED, which indicates you are sending a private message.*

(* Ello private messaging feature is still in development and is not yet active. It will be released soon. See below for a longer explanation of how private messaging works.)

## How do I create a post that contains a mixture of images, text, video, links, etc.?

Each Omnibar post can be made up of multiple containers. Each container can hold an image, text, video links, and more. Containers can be re-ordered on the fly, which gives you a great deal of control over how your posts look.

To create a new image container from a text container, simply click on the image icon at the bottom right corner of the open Omnibar. To create a new text container from an image container, just start typing in the blank container at the bottom of the Omnibar.

## How can I rearrange the order of images, text, and other stuff I put in the Omnibar?

Click and drag the arrow icon in the corner of each container in the Omnibar to move it up and down, until it snaps to the desired position within your post.

## How can I format text and add links to my posts in the Omnibar?

The simplest way is to highlight the portion of text that you want to format. A small edit menu pops up that allows you to add a link, or change the style of your text to bold or italic.

![Edit Menu](https://d324imu86q1bqn.cloudfront.net/uploads/asset/attachment/1712/ello-xhdpi-f49a488a.jpg)

Alternatively, you can use [Ello Markdown](https://ello.co/wtf/post/using-ello-markdown-to-format-text) to create advanced text formatting. Read how [here](https://ello.co/wtf/post/using-ello-markdown-to-format-text).

## How can I add emoji to my posts?

To use an emoji in your post, begin by typing a colon : in your post or comment. A pop-up menu will appear offering you a choice of Emojis! [Read more here.](/wtf/resources/emojis/)

## Can I use big images and enter lots of text?

Ello can display large, full-screen images and very long text posts. There is no size limit.

## How can I view giant images that don’t fit my screen?

Resize large images just by clicking on them.

## Can I comment on a post?

Yes! Click on the three grey dots underneath the post to show its comments. A box will appear for you to enter your comment.

![Comments icon](https://d324imu86q1bqn.cloudfront.net/uploads/asset/attachment/2199978/ello-xhdpi-234d1d5b.jpg)

## Can I repost another person's post?

Yes. Just hit the repost button underneath the post you like, and you will see the original post in your Omnibar. Add additional thoughts below the original post and hit the grey arrow to submit your post.

Next to the repost icon, you will see a grey number. Click it to see everyone that’s reposted that post. If you don’t want anyone to repost your posts, you can disable reposting on your Settings page.

## If I delete a post, what happens to reposts of my post?

All reposts of your post will be deleted too.

## How can I use the discover tool to find interesting people and/or things to follow?

Click on the [discover](/discover) icon. Select "Recommended", "Related", or "Random". Select users based on the content that you find interesting, or open up the drawer and quickly add users based on their avatar.

![Discover icon](https://d324imu86q1bqn.cloudfront.net/uploads/asset/attachment/2385622/ello-xhdpi-aa7079df.jpg)

## How can I search for users by username or name?

Click the search icon, and type in the username or name that you're looking for.

![Search icon](https://d324imu86q1bqn.cloudfront.net/uploads/asset/attachment/2385623/ello-xhdpi-23fb718d.jpg)

Content search, which will allow you to search Ello posts by keyword, will be added in the near future.

## How do I find other people that share my interests?

Content search, #tagging, and groups are coming. In the meantime, we’re experimenting with community pages (repurposed user accounts) led by real humans. Check out the community directory [here](/wtf/resources/community-directory/).

## How do I invite my friends?

Navigate to your [Settings](/settings) page. Click the invite icon and follow the instructions.

![Invite icon](https://d324imu86q1bqn.cloudfront.net/uploads/asset/attachment/2199981/ello-xhdpi-2ee92e83.jpg)

Friends can also join on the [Ello Home Page](/).

## How can I keep Ello organized using the FRIENDS and NOISE streams?

When we first created Ello, we wanted to avoid the clutter associated with other social networks. So we created two streams, FRIENDS and NOISE. This means that you have two places to put the people you follow!

You can use FRIENDS and NOISE any way you like, but after two years of using Ello with our own friends, this is what we recommend:

Put the people you care about most in the FRIENDS stream. FRIENDS uses an expanded list layout, it is easy to view each of your friend's posts in detail, full-screen.

Use the NOISE stream to follow anything and everything else. NOISE has a compressed, fluid grid layout that makes it easy to browse and scan lots of text and images quickly.

Only you can see who is in your FRIENDS stream and who is in your NOISE stream. Nobody else will ever know where you have put them, so you don't have to worry about hurting anybody else's feelings.

More info [here](https://ello.co/wtf/post/friendsandnoise).

## How do I open and close the drawer to see an expanded, full page view of Ello?

Click on the drawer icon to open and close the drawer.

![Drawer icon](https://d324imu86q1bqn.cloudfront.net/uploads/asset/attachment/931/ello-xhdpi-97c69972.jpg)

## How do I see a single user's profile page and posts?

With the drawer open, click on their avatar from your FRIEND or NOISE avatar list. You can also click on their avatar from the search view. This is a great way to quickly navigate between friends to see what they are up to.

## How can I see all my own posts (and nobody else's)?

Click on your avatar at the top of your stream (or next to any one of your posts).

## How do I view an individual post?

Click on the time stamp (e.g. “4d”) next to the post.

## How do I get to my Settings?

You can get to your [Settings](/settings) page from your profile page. Click on your avatar to get to your profile, and then click on the Settings icon.

![Settings icon](https://d324imu86q1bqn.cloudfront.net/uploads/asset/attachment/932/ello-xhdpi-fae005cf.jpg)

## How can I change my avatar and header?

Click the gear icon to go to your [Settings](/settings) page, then drag & drop new images. Alternatively, click the image icon to use your browser to select a file from your computer or mobile device.

## How do I log out?

You can log out by clicking the “Logout” link in the upper right hand corner of the [Settings](/settings) page.

## How can I permanently delete my Ello account?

Go to your [Settings](/settings) page by clicking on the gear icon, and click the "Delete Account" link. Once you delete your account neither you, nor we, can recover it. It's over, baby. Also note that your username may become available for another user to use.
