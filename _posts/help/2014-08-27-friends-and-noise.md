One of the things we wanted most when we set out to create Ello was a system to help manage clutter. On other social networks we often found ourselves sifting through hundreds of posts that we weren’t very interested in, trying to find posts by the people that we really cared about most.

The solution we came up with for Ello is called FRIENDS & NOISE.

Here’s how it works:

Follow the people you care about most in FRIENDS, which displays each post in an expanded, list format. It’s a great way to look at full-sized content by people you are really interested in following.

Put everyone else in NOISE, which offers a compressed, fluid-grid based layout that makes it easy for browsing lots of posts quickly.

Nobody except you can see whether you are following someone in FRIENDS or NOISE, so you never have to worry about hurting anyone’s feelings!

As a general guideline, we have found that following more than about 60 people in FRIENDS starts to cause clutter. When this happens, you will find it is very natural to start dragging people over to NOISE.

## How can I add someone to FRIENDS or NOISE?

Go to the user’s profile page and click on FRIENDS or NOISE in the upper right-hand corner. You can also drag their user icon onto either the FRIENDS or NOISE tab.

## How do I move people I am following between FRIENDS and NOISE?

On a laptop or desktop computer, simply drag and drop user icons into the FRIENDS or NOISE tabs.

You can move people in bulk by scrolling through the full list of people you are following (click the followers link on your profile page, and then click the FRIENDS or NOISE button next to each user avatar).

## How can I stop following someone in my FRIENDS or NOISE stream?

Go to the user’s profile page and hover over the grey-ed button in the right-hand corner. When it turns red, click and the user will be removed from that stream.

## Can I view NOISE using the same expanded layout as FRIENDS?

Yes. Toggle your NOISE layout back and forth from expanded to compressed view by pressing Shift—5.
