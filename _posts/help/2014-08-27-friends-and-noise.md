One of the things we wanted most when we set out to create Ello was a system to help manage clutter. On other networks we often found ourselves sifting through hundreds of posts that we weren’t very interested in, trying to find posts by the people that we really cared about most.

The solution we came up with for Ello is called FRIENDS & NOISE.

Here’s how it works:

Follow the people you care about most in FRIENDS, which displays each post in an expanded, list format. It’s a great way to look at full-sized content by people you are really interested in following.

Put everyone else in NOISE, which offers a compressed, fluid-grid based layout that makes it easy for browsing lots of posts quickly.

Nobody except you can see whether you are following someone in FRIENDS or NOISE, so you never have to worry about hurting anyone’s feelings!

As a general guideline, we have found that following more than about 60 people in FRIENDS starts to cause clutter. When this happens, you will find it is very natural to start dragging people over to NOISE.

## How can I add someone to FRIENDS or NOISE?

Go to the person’s profile page and click on FOLLOW button. You will have the option to select FRIEND or NOISE.

## How do I move people I am following between FRIENDS and NOISE?

Scroll through the full list of people you are following (click the followers link on your profile page, and then click the FOLLOW button next to each person's avatar).

## How can I stop following someone in my FRIENDS or NOISE stream?

Go to the person’s profile page, click the button that says FRIEND or NOISE (depending on which stream they are in), and select "Unfollow" from the pop-up menu. 

## Can I view NOISE using the same expanded layout as FRIENDS, and vice-versa?

Yes! If you are using Ello on the web, toggle back and forth from expanded to grid view by clicking the grid/list icons at the bottom right corner of your window.  You can also use the = hotkey if you want to switch on the fly.

Ello will remember your view preferences on each of your devices, so the next time you return your views will remain the same!
