## What is Ello?

Ello is a revolutionary social network that is transforming how people connect—where you have the freedom to be whoever you want to be, and where quality, beauty, and positivity are valued over advertising, manipulation, and exploitation.

Ello was founded by a small group of artists and programmers who had become disillusioned by all the big social networks, which had become ugly, cluttered, and full of advertisements. They just weren’t any fun any fun any more.

So we decided to build our own.

We posted the [Ello Manifesto](/wtf/about/ello-manifesto/), promising to never, ever sell advertising or user data. Read more about the Ello no-ad policy [here](/wtf/about/ello-tracking-and-your-data/).

Then we got to work designing the clean and beautiful social network that we ourselves wanted to use.

Ello launched in late 2014 with just 90 people on the network, and there are millions of people here today. Ello remains creative, open, free, and extremely positive.

Join the revolution.

## Can anyone join Ello?

Everyone is welcome, but Ello isn’t for everyone.

Some social networks claim they want to sign up everyone in the world. This is not Ello’s mission. We’re committed to creating the best social network, not the biggest.

Ello is still in Beta, with new features coming every week. Every time a new feature comes out, Ello becomes useful to a wider circle of people.

## Ello is in Beta. What does this mean?

Ello is released in stages, with new features coming out all the time. This allows us to test Ello, see how things are working, and make sure our servers can handle the load before we move on.

When using Ello during the Beta testing phase, you may occasionally run into bugs. Things that worked one way yesterday may work differently today. A new feature may suddenly appear (we’re releasing new features almost every day). That’s the fun of the Beta experience — participating as Ello rolls out from scratch.

## What features are working now?

Many features are working perfectly, and others are coming soon. You can see the complete feature list by clicking a link in the grey bar at the top of the page when you first visit Ello, or [here](/wtf/resources/feature-list/).

## You’ve said that Ello will not sell ads or sell user data to third parties. Is that really true?

Yes.

## Never?

Never.

Hang on. Are companies welcome on Ello? What if they post ads?

People and companies are welcome on Ello.

They can post whatever they want.

What’s different about Ello is that what you see is completely under your control. We will never boost paid posts or include ads in your stream.

So if someone joins Ello, you are free to follow them or not follow them. What you see is up to you.

## I saw an ad on a video someone posted on Ello.

We do not control what people post on Ello as long as they follow the Rules.

At the request of many of our users, Ello supports embedded content from YouTube, Vimeo, Soundcloud, and many other media formats that sometimes have ads embedded in them by third parties.

Ello does not make money on these advertisements, and if you don’t want to see them, you don’t have to follow users who post them. And if you want to avoid ads completely, you can also turn off embedded content completely on your Ello settings page.

## What kind of information does Ello collect about me, and how can I opt out?

By default Ello collects anonymized user behavior, which helps us understand how people are using Ello and how we can make the network better.

If you don’t want to participate, you can opt out on your Ello settings page.

Read more about how Ello collects and uses information [here](/wtf/about/information-use/).

## How does Ello support itself?

Beginning later this year, Ello will offer special paid services and features in the form of an app store. These features will be totally optional, and the social network side of Ello will always be free, so Ello is supported by its community, not advertisers.

## Is it your goal to shut Facebook down?

Ello is not anti-anything.

From our perspective, ad-based social networks are not really social networks at all. They’re advertising platforms where the data aggregator is the customer, and the user is the product that is being bought and sold. We have nothing against those other networks, and if you prefer them to Ello, or wish to use them as well as Ello, we encourage you to do so.

## Does Ello work on mobile devices and tablets?

You can use Ello on tablets and smartphones (including Apple, Android, and Windows-based devices) through the web browser. Ello works great on mobile, and we suggest simply bookmarking Ello on the home screen of your mobile device.

We are releasing our native iPhone and Android apps very soon — with Windows Mobile coming shortly thereafter.

## Where can I find more help and other information on how to use Ello?

Visit the [Ello Tips](/wtf/help/tips/) section.

## What’s the best way to use the FRIENDS & NOISE feeds on Ello?

We built two different streams, called FRIENDS & NOISE, to help you contain clutter and keep Ello organized.

Read more about the best way to use FRIENDS & NOISE [here](/wtf/help/friends-and-noise/).

## Does Ello allow NSFW & adult content?

Yes.

Not everyone wants to see sexually explicit content. If you regularly post adult content, please respect those in our community who do not wish to see it by flagging your Ello profile as NSFW on your settings page once this feature is available. Doing so will screen your content from Ello users who would prefer not to see it. Failure to mark NSFW content may lead to a warning, or eventually having your account locked, or deleted.

You can hide sexually explicit material from your Ello experience by setting the “View NSFW” setting is set to “No” on your personal Ello settings page.

All posts, including NSFW content, must comply with Ello’s Rules. Among other things, we expressly forbid explicit content that involves children, animals, or that portrays or encourages hurting people.

## Are there any restrictions on how many people I can follow on Ello?

During Beta, you are limited to following 100 new users per day on Ello.
