**What we are looking for**

Ello and Talenthouse are looking for engineers to help us grow and maintain the infrastructure and code that power talenthouse.com and ello.co.  We would like one engineer to be U.S. based, and one in the U.K.

This is a rare opportunity work on an incredible software stack. Ello is the Creators Network, and we serve millions of requests per day. Our software stack runs on AWS and Heroku, and is written in Ruby and Elixir. Talenthouse has become the best place for brands to connect to the world's best artists. Our backend is written in Scala.

We are looking for an experienced engineer to join our team to help grow our brands and to maintain our current applications.  Your primary job function will be to work in Scala to support the Talenthouse web application, but you will also be helping on the Ello stack.

You can check out Ello's open source repos at [github.com/ello](https://github.com/ello).

**About Talenthouse**

Talenthouse was built to help professional creatives be seen, heard and compensated. Since 2009, Talenthouse has democratized creative work, giving independent artists from all over the world direct access to creative briefs from leading brands, agencies and entertainment icons.

**About Ello**

Ello is the Creators Network. Our mission is to provide Artists, Writers, Photographers and other creators with opportunities to build their reputation and get paid. Every day Ello serves millions of views to our passionate community - your work at Ello will matter.

You can learn more about Ello, including our stance on privacy and user data on our [help site](https://ello.co/wtf), also make sure to poke around ello.co

**Working with us**

We are a small, distributed team of experienced designers and engineers. We work US hours and collaborate via Slack and Github. Most of our software is developed in the open as public repositories under an MIT license (except our Rails API).

Ello is built with modern technology, React, Redux, Kotlin, and Swift on the front ends, Ruby, Elixir and Go on the back end. We deploy frequently (except not on Fridays) to Heroku and AWS.

Our routine consists of:

* Daily “standup” slack messages following standard scrum
* Daily “watercooler” calls where we just chat about casual topics
* Weekly planning meetings
* Bi-weekly retrospectives
* Weekly cross department standups

Planning is collaborative - some of our most successful features and initiatives have been proposed by the dev team.
