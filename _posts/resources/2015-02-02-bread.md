Before the days of “Loves” on Ello, German users started posting the :bread: emoji when they liked something. This spread to other users like wildfire, and people still use the bread emoji today to tell someone they especially love a post.

Create the loaf of bread by typing:

{% comment %}
A known issue that doesn’t seem like it will get fixed until Jekyll 2.0
prevents us from _not_ rendering an emoji image tag inside a code block
(https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji/issues/12)

This is the work-around.
{% endcomment %}

`{{ '&#58;bread&#58;' | markdownify | strip_html }}`

You can also click the Love icon that lives below each post.

Your Love stream is also a bookmarking tool: from your profile, click “Loves” to see every post you’ve ever loved.

Other ad-based networks make money if you “like” lots of things. Each time you do, they record what you like. The more they know about you, the more money they make when they sell your data to advertisers.

Because Ello doesn’t have ads, your Loves will never be sold or used for marketing purposes.

Of course there’s nothing wrong with a quick “Love”! But with the Loves stream, we are moving away from the goal of just “counting Likes” and “collecting as many followers as possible”.

Ello is about quality, not quantity.

Leave a comment. Post :bread:. Give Love.
