**Note:**

Ello doesn’t censor.

However, Apple iOS rules block the sharing of NSFW content through iOS apps. Accounts & posts marked NSFW will not appear in search results on the Ello iOS App but will appear when using Ello on the web.

If you want your posts to appear on Ello iOS, please set "Post Adult Content" to "No"!

## Ello App for Android

An Android App is an important part of Ello's future.

We are currently improving the Ello interface and gearing up to release many new features later this year. We plan to get an awesome Android App out to all of you following that.
