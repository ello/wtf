**Note:**

Ello doesn’t censor.

However, Apple iOS rules block the sharing of NSFW content through iOS apps. Accounts & posts marked NSFW will not appear in search results on the Ello iOS App but will appear when using Ello on the web. 

If you want your posts to appear on Ello iOS, please set "Post Adult Content" to "No"!
