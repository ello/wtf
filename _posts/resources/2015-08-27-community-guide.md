**There are a lot of amazing new communities on Ello. Here’s a quick guide to help you create your own community, and some suggestions on how to gain new followers and make yours awesome!**

Community accounts are just like any other account on Ello. To create one of your own, simply log out from your personal account, make a new account from the Ello home page using an appropriate name for your community, and begin posting!

Over months of watching communities grow, we’ve learned some practices that can help make your your Ello community thrive:

* **Post regularly to keep your followers engaged and excited.** Communities work best when their moderators post at least once every three days, but not more than five posts per day. If you submit your posts all at once every day they may stop following you. We recommend no more than two posts per hour.

* **Don’t mass-follow people or mention unrelated users in your posts as a way to gain follow-backs.** This can appear spammy and usually backfires.

* **You may get submissions from the people who are following your community**. It’s awesome when this happens. Do your best to post or repost only the highest-quality submissions you receive! It really is OK not to repost everything that people submit to you — always write a friendly comment or “love” their submission as a way to thank them for sending something in, even if you aren’t going to use their post.

* **Use large, high-quality images whenever possible.** Images that are 1000 pixels wide or larger look best on Ello.

* **Add personality to your posts.** At least a quarter of your posts should be in your own voice. Keep things alive by adding comments when you repost someone else’s post. 

* **Format your posts.** You can use bold, italics, and hyperlinks in your text. Keep longer text blocks short and readable by breaking them up with regular line breaks. 

* **Most of all, have fun!**

##What’s an “Ello Featured Community”?

Exceptional communities that build a substantial following may be asked to become an “Ello Featured Community”. Think “Employee of the Month,” but for communities! 

Ello Featured Communities can show up on the Ello homepage, may be recommended when people create new accounts, or listed in the Ello Community Directory.

Communities that are featured usually:

* Have at least 150 followers
* Have at least 15 high-quality posts
* Use large, high-resolution photos
* Format text for visual appeal
* Post inspiring and relevant topics
* Have a clear, explanatory bio
* Post regularly but not excessively

If you’d like your community to be considered as an Ello Featured Community, please e-mail the Ello Community Support Team at hello@ello.co, and we’ll get back to you.

Have fun building communities on Ello!

Love,

Ello
Beautiful & Ad-free
