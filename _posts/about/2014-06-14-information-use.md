When you use Ello, we collect some information related to your visit. This information helps us understand how people are using Ello, so we can make Ello better.

For example, if we create a feature that everybody is using, we want to know about that. If we have a lot of visitors from The Netherlands (which we do) then we might translate our Help section into Dutch (which we are considering, except none of us speak Dutch).

After a great deal of research and internal debate, we decided to use an anonymized version of Google Analytics to collect visitor data. As of May 2015, we have also started using Segment. If that is something you are uncomfortable with, we also offer the option to opt-out.

This solution offers an acceptable level of anonymity and privacy, while providing us with the information we need to make Ello great. As more advanced privacy technology is developed, Ello is committed to adopting that technology as soon as it is feasible for us to do so.

## How It Works

The information Ello collects includes your location, language, referring web site, and time spent visiting Ello.

This information is anonymous and aggregated. Before information about you is stored on the Google/Segment servers, your IP address is stripped and anonymized. This means that it is very difficult for anyone (including Ello, Google, and Segment) to trace that data back to any specific user. We can see how people are using Ello in general, but not what you are doing in particular.

To the best of our knowledge, this also makes what you do on Ello useless to Google for advertising purposes.

## You Can Opt Out

There are some people using Ello who don’t want to share any information, even anonymous information, about themselves with anybody. We’re cool with that.

On your Ello settings page, you can choose to turn Google Analytics and Segment off completely when you visit Ello. Ello also respects [Do Not Track (DNT)](http://donottrack.us/) settings in browsers. In these cases Ello will not send any information about your visit to Google at all.*

Please read The Ello [Privacy Policy](/wtf/policies/privacy-policy/) in full.

_* If you choose to use a Chrome web browser, an Android smartphone, or if you have recently used services like Google Search or YouTube, your web browser or device may be sending data back to Google that Ello can’t control._
