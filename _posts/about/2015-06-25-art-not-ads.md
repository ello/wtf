_Art not Ads_ is an Ello-funded initiative that supports artists making art about issues that matter to the Ello community. 

Rather than spending the bulk of Ello’s marketing energy on advertising like most businesses, Ello instead offers grants to Ello artists to produce meaningful work about subjects such as privacy, connection, control, inspiration and more. 

Our current 2015 grants schedule is filled. Check back here for more information about 2016 grants when we’re ready.
