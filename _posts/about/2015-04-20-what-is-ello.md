Ello is a place to discover beautiful art, be inspired by meaningful stories, and connect with creators around the world.

In the beginning Ello was a private social network, built by a [small group of creators](/wtf/about/who-created-ello/) who had become frustrated by the negativity that had invaded the big social networks. Many of us felt obliged to have profiles on those networks, but nobody was having much fun. 

We built Ello as an oasis, a place of our own to share the things we love with friends and peers. After a while so many people were asking to join our little private network that we realized it was time to make Ello public.

[The Ello Bill of Rights](https://bill-of-rights.ello.co/) states that every social media user should have the right to control everything that they see. Because Ello will always be ad-free and will never sell user data. , there are no algorithms that prioritize paid content over posts by people you love — Ello is presented in simple chronological order. This means that the many artists, storytellers, entrepreneurs, journalists, technologists, adventurers, car enthusiasts, whiskey lovers, and creators of all kinds never have to pay for followers to read their posts. 

That’s a big reason why so many creative people are connecting and finding inspiration on Ello. 

Another is our commitment to beauty, safety, and transparency. As a [Public Benefit Corporation](https://ello.co/wtf/about/pbc/) Ello is legally required to work for the benefit of everyone on our network.

All that said, what matters most is how much fun we’re having building this positive creative network together. Ello encourages us to take a stand for the things we love, to be grateful for the people that inspire us, and to become our best selves. We’re so glad you’re here.

Be inspired, and have fun on Ello.
