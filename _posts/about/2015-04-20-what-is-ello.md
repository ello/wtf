Ello is a beautiful & ad-free social network where you can connect with friends, be inspired, and share what matters most. Ello’s gorgeous fullscreen design supports high-res images, long form text, GIFs, video, sound files — you name it — without the clutter you’ll find on other ad-based social networks.

In the beginning Ello was a private social network, created by a [small group of artists](/wtf/about/who-created-ello/) who had grown tired of the negativity, clutter, data mining, and ads that had invaded other social networks. Many of us felt obligated to have pages on those other networks, but nobody was really having fun. So we built a network of our own.

One of the fundamental principles behind Ello is that you always control what you see. You will never be forced to see paid ads or boosted posts. There are no algorithms that prioritize paid content over messages from your friends, which means you can always post the things you love for all your followers to see for free. 

On Ello, nobody collects and sells data about you to the highest bidder. Never ever. This commitment is one reason why Ello remains so positive and so much fun, since every feature we create is really just for you. There’s nobody messing with us behind the scenes.

We invited our friends to join Ello, and our friends invited their friends. Many of them are well known artists, designers, and musicians, who brought their fans along with them. Soon thousands, and then millions of people began signing up. 

We posted the [Ello Manifesto](/wtf/about/ello-manifesto/) on the home page to let people know what we’re about, and then we opened Ello to anyone who values beauty, positivity, and connecting with people and things they love.

There is a better way.

We’re so glad you’re here.

Love, 

Ello
