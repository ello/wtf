Ello was created by seven artists as a beautiful & ad-free social network, an alternative to the status quo.

We were fed up with big social networks that had grown cluttered with ads, that use algorithms to control what we see, and that are clearly more interested in collecting as much data as possible about us than maintaining a positive, inspiring community.

The situation has become like George Orwell’s 1984 — these corporations track and record everything we do, and sell us to the highest bidder for profit, manipulation, and control.

To honor of the spirit of U.S. Independence Day on July 4, 2015, Ello released the Ello Bill of Rights for social networks.

The document outlines 10 basic rights that all social networks should provide to their users. These include rights to privacy and transparency, the right to control and own what you post, the right to relationships that won't be exploited for gain, the right to delete your account permanently at any time, and more.

All of these principals are the building blocks of Ello, and fundamental reasons why this networks remains so beautiful, positive, and inspiring.

**There is a better way.**
