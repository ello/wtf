To honor the spirit of U.S. Independence Day on July 4, 2015, Ello released the [Ello Bill of Rights for Social Network Users](https://bill-of-rights.ello.co/).

The document outlines 10 basic rights that all social networks should provide to their users. These include rights to privacy and transparency, the right to control and own what you post, the right to relationships that won't be exploited for gain, the right to delete your account permanently at any time, and more.

All of these principles are the building blocks of Ello, and fundamental reasons why Ello remains so beautiful, positive, and inspiring.

**There is a better way.**
