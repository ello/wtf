Ello launched in 2014 as a private network, built by a [small group of seven friends](https://ello.co/wtf/about/who-created-ello/). Our goal was to create a network different from anything out there, and to move people in a new direction.
 
People quickly signed up to become part of a community that offered something different. They found inspiration in photos and stories shared by people around the world. They shared things of their own. Ello has become a home for authentic content that isn’t posted anywhere else. More importantly, Ello is a place where people are free to feel like they belong.  
 
Ello was created for your inspiration. It’s a place to get lost and found in new images, stories, and people you won’t experience anywhere else. 
 
Networks fit many needs. On Ello, we’re here to provide the best experience possible for the creators that make up the core of our community. 

Ello is still in Beta. We are always adding new features and improving functionality. You can download the [Ello iOS App](http://appstore.com/ello/ello), and an Android App is in the works.

Stay tuned, much more on the way!
