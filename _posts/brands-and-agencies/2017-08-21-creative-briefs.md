**Ello’s Invite technology connects the Ello artist community with brands, agencies, publishers and fans through real-time creative briefs.** Working in close collaboration with our clients we launch brief-driven, on-demand creative projects that **activate and engage our global community of 625K artists in 175 countries**.

Participation is simple. Artists submit their work to the Creative Briefs they’re interested in [here](https://ello.co/invites). Selected artists are chosen by a vetted, unbiased panel of judges and are awarded for their creative work per the criteria of the Creative Brief.

To learn more about participating in Ello Creative Briefs contact us at ArtistInvites@ello.co.
