*Not for Print* (NFP) is **Ello’s artist-powered print publication**. Submission-based and published quarterly, each issue focuses on a relevant artistic theme and is curated to showcase the creative talent on Ello. NFP is about **taking Ello’s internet culture to the printed page** and giving credit where it’s due.

Each quarter we choose a culturally relevant theme and using our [Artist Invites](https://ello.co/artist-invites) technology publish a creative brief to the community seeking submissions. Selected artists are chosen by a vetted, unbiased panel of judges and their works are published in NFP per the criteria of the invite. Each edition of NFP is sponsored by a value-aligned, artists-first brand partner.
