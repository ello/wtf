Ello’s **Artist Invite technology connects the Ello artist community with brands, agencies, publishers and fans through real-time creative briefs.** Working in close collaboration with our clients we launch brief-driven, on-demand creative projects that activate and engage our global community of artists in 195 countries.

Participation is simple. Artists submit their work to the Artist Invites they’re interested in. Selected artists are chosen by a vetted, unbiased panel of judges and are awarded for their creative work per the criteria of the invite.

To learn more about participating in Ello Artist Invites contact us at ArtistInvites@ello.co.

Be sure to check out our [Artist Invite Rules](/wtf/policies/artist-invite-rules).
