Ello’s **Creative Brief technology connects the Ello artist community with brands, agencies, publishers and fans through real-time creative briefs.** Working in close collaboration with our clients we launch brief-driven, on-demand creative projects that activate and engage our global community of 625K artists in 175 countries.

Participation is simple. Artists submit their work to the Creative Brief they’re interested in [here](https://ello.co/invites). Selected artists are chosen by a vetted, unbiased panel of judges and are awarded for their creative work per the criteria of the invite.

To learn more about participating in Ello Creative Briefs contact us at ArtistInvites@ello.co.

Be sure to check out our [Invite Rules](/wtf/policies/invite-rules).
