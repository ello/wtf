Each quarter we launch a creative brief using our Creative Briefs technology to select ten artists for publication in _[Underscore](https://ello.co/artist-invites/underscore-vol-1)_. One artist receives their own book — a monograph featuring their work and ideas — while nine others are interviewed and published in the accompanying zine. Selected artists are chosen by a vetted, unbiased panel of judges and their works are published per the criteria of the brief.
