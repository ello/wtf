Books matter, and for an artist, being published in a lasting piece of print goes a long way towards advancing a career. That’s why  **we publish *[Underscore](https://ello.co/artist-invites/underscore-vol-1)*, a premium, perfect bound quarterly monograph** packaged **with an extra-special accompanying artist interview zine**.

Each quarter we launch a creative brief using our [Artist Invites](/wtf/artists/invites) technology to select ten artists for publication in *Underscore*. One artist receives their own book — a monograph featuring their work and ideas — while nine others are interviewed and published in the accompanying zine. Selected artists are chosen by a vetted, unbiased panel of judges and their works are published per the criteria of the invite.
