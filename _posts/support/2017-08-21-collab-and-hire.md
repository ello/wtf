Ello’s **Hire Me Button** tells potential clients you’re available for work and provides an easy way for them to contact you privately. Similarly, our **Collaborate Button** gives fellow Ello creators interested in collaborating with you a simple way to get in touch privately.

**To enable our Hire Me & Collaborate Buttons:**

* Visit <a href="https://ello.co/settings">Settings</a> and scroll down to “Hire Me Button” or “Collaborate Button“
* Toggle the “Hire Me Button” or “Collaborate Button“ setting from “no” to “yes”
* Check out the “Hire Me” or “Collaborate“ button on your profile
* Use the button to send an email to the Ello member you’d like to hire or collab with
* Respond to a request if you’re into the opportunity and carry on the conversation privately
