Ello works tirelessly to support and promote as many of our artist community members as possible by featuring members in our curated Discover categories. Featured members have their posts displayed in one or more of our curated categories and become part of our ongoing human-curated rotation. Existing featured members are regularly cycled to allow us to bring on new featured members in an effort to expose and amplify as much of the exceptional work and ideas found on Ello as possible.

Your posts will only show up in a specific Discover category if you or your work are featured in that category. If there's a specific category you'd like to have your work featured in, let us know at hello@ello.co.
