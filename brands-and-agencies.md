**Ello connects brands, agencies and publishers with a global community of 625K creatives from 175 countries by launching brief-driven creative projects using our [Creative Brief](https://ello.co/invites) technology.** Projects are vetted, criteria and project duration are set, awards are determined and projects are launched to the Ello artist community. Submissions are solicited and selected in real-time and top-tier creative work is delivered at scale

At Ello we’re **providing new and more meaningful ways to connect with desired audiences.** We’re empowering brands to act as patrons of creativity and the arts. By bringing creative projects and artistic opportunities to Ello and investing in our community, **deeper, more lasting brand affinity is cultivated.** Reach becomes a byproduct of support.
